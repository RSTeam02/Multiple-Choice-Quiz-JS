# Multiple Choice Quiz in JavaScript (ECMAScript)

The same task is already implemented in C/C++, now written in an OO language like JS (ECMAScript). The questions are now stored in an array of structured JSON objects as *.json.

structure:
```
[
    {
        "quiz": "99 is equal to:",
        "answer": {
            "3*30+3Â²": "+",
            "2*33": "-",
            "11*9": "+"
        }
    },...
]  
```

progress:
+ Player: set/get player name and score
+ Question: question object with question, answer, solution possibilities attributes as string
+ Controller: create new question instance for each question loaded from json fileloader, create player with name and current score, input validation: check if certain char is in solution string, prevent double chars DDDAAABBB => ABD, score rules: 0.25 points per right answer, -0.25 points per wrong answer, 0 pts per no answer 
+ JSONFileReader: get json from file 
+ Shuffle: shuffle quiz, answer orders. (Yates shuffle)
+ View: print current question with answers as preformatted text in html
